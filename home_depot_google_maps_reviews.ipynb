    "\"Service\", \"rude\", and \"help\" show up a combined total of 22 times in 37 one-star reviews. Home Depot's inverted pyramid structure puts customers at the top, and great customer service is one of the Home Depot's core values. I myslef have experienced exemplary customer service whenever I go into a Home Depot store, and I know that instances of employees being rude to customers is the exception not the norm. However, I believe any and all customer concerns should be given their due diligence, so one might look further into these reviews. Again, I expect these reviews to be the exception, as the avergae rating for the Dripping Springs store is high at 4.2/5 out of over 500 ratings. That being said, small problems have a habit of becoming larger ones if left unchecked."
